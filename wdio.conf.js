    // =====================
    // Host address of the running Selenium server. This information is usually obsolete as
    // WebdriverIO automatically connects to localhost. Also if you are using one of the
    // supported cloud services like Sauce Labs, Browserstack or Testing Bot you also don't
    // need to define host and port information because WebdriverIO can figure that out
    // according to your user and key information. However if you are using a private Selenium
    // backend you should define the host address, port, and path here.
    //
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 4444,
    path: '/wd/hub',
    //
    // =================
    // Service Providers
    // =================
    // WebdriverIO supports Sauce Labs, Browserstack and Testing Bot (other cloud providers
    // should work too though). These services define specific user and key (or access key)
    // values you need to put in here in order to connect to these services.
    //
    // user: 'webdriverio',
    // key: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxxxx',
    //
    // ==================
    // Specify Test Files
    // ==================
    // Define which test specs should run. The pattern is relative to the directory
    // from which `wdio` was called. Notice that, if you are calling `wdio` from an
    // NPM script (see https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script) then the current working
    // directory is where your package.json resides, so `wdio` will be called from there.
    //
    specs: ['./specs/**/*.spec.js'],
    // Patterns to exclude.
    exclude: [],
    //
    // ============
    // Capabilities
    // ============
    // Define your capabilities here. WebdriverIO can run multiple capabilities at the same
    // time. Depending on the number of capabilities, WebdriverIO launches several test
    // sessions. Within your capabilities you can overwrite the spec and exclude option in
    // order to group specific specs to a specific capability.
    //
    //
    // First you can define how many instances should be started at the same time. Let's
    // say you have 3 different capabilities (Chrome, Firefox and Safari) and you have
    // set maxInstances to 1, wdio will spawn 3 processes. Therefor if you have 10 spec
    // files and you set maxInstances to 10, all spec files will get tested at the same time
    // and 30 processes will get spawned. The property basically handles how many capabilities
    // from the same test should run tests.
    //
    //
    //
    // When enabled opens a debug port for node-inspector and pauses execution
    // on `debugger` statements. The node-inspector can be attached with:
    // `node-inspector --debug-port 5859 --no-preload`
    // When debugging it is also recommended to change the timeout interval of
    // test runner (eg. jasmineNodeOpts.defaultTimeoutInterval) to a very high
    // value and setting maxInstances to 1.
    debug: false,
    //
    // Additional list node arguments to use when starting child processes
    execArgv: null,
    //
    //
    // ===================
    // Test Configurations
    // ===================
    // Define all options that are relevant for the WebdriverIO instance here
    //
    // Per default WebdriverIO commands getting executed in a synchronous way using
    // the wdio-sync package. If you still want to run your tests in an async way
    // using promises you can set the sync command to false.
    sync: true,
    //
    // Level of logging verbosity: silent | verbose | command | data | result | error
    logLevel: 'silent',
    //
    // Enables colors for log output.
    coloredLogs: true,
    //
    // Warns when a deprecated command is used
    deprecationWarnings: true,
    //
    // If you only want to run your tests until a specific amount of tests have failed use
    // bail (default is 0 - don't bail, run all tests).
    bail: 0,
    //
    // Saves a screenshot to a given path if a command fails.
    screenshotPath: '.reports/shots',
    //
    // Set a base URL in order to shorten url command calls. If your `url` parameter starts
    // with `/`, the base url gets prepended, not including the path portion of your baseUrl.
    // If your `url` parameter starts without a scheme or `/` (like `some/path`), the base url
    // gets prepended directly.
    baseUrl: 'http://localhost:8080',
    //
    // Default timeout for all waitForXXX commands.
    waitforTimeout: 1000,
    //
    // Initialize the browser instance with a WebdriverIO plugin. The object should have the
    // plugin name as key and the desired plugin options as property. Make sure you have
    // the plugin installed before running any tests. The following plugins are currently
    // available:
    // WebdriverCSS: https://github.com/webdriverio/webdrivercss
    // WebdriverRTC: https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverrtc
    // Browserevent: https://github.com/webdriverio/browserevent
